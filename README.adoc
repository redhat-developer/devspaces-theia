## What's inside?

NOTE: the so-called master branch is deprecated and is no longer kept up to date. Instead, the latest nightly sources are in **devspaces-3-rhel-8 branch**, synced to upstream projects' main (or master) branches.

For the latest stable release, see the **devspaces-3.y-rhel-8** branch with the largest y value.

This repo contains the code for the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces build of Theia, based on the link:https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-theia[che-theia] project.

## Create dockerfiles for theia in brew

`./build.sh` will:

* fetch che-theia
* generate `:next` tmp images from ubi8 config to be used for grabing assets
* generate into `dockerfiles` directory the assets / Dockerfile

Steps: 

* `./build.sh`
* check `dockerfiles` directory with ready-to-go Dockerfile with already included in folders

### A note about SVG files 

If using Inkscape to save files, make sure you export as *Plain SVG*, then edit the resulting .svg file to remove any `<metadata>...</metadata>` tags and all their contents. You can also remove the `xmlns:rdf` definition. This will ensure they compile correctly.
